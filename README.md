# google-locations
This code accompanies the ShmooCon 2018 talk: "OK Google, Tell Me About Myself."  With this code, I attempt to infer information about my daily life (i.e., identify significant locations in my life such as home, when I am most likely to be home) using a Location History file downloaded from https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout .
